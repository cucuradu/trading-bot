# Trading Strategy

## Mission
Forward-test this strategy on an Alpaca paper account for 10–12 weeks. Goal: beat the S&P 500 over the validation window. Stocks only — no options, ever.

## Capital & Constraints
- Starting capital (paper): ~$100,000
- Platform: Alpaca (paper)
- Instruments: Stocks ONLY
- PDT limit: 3 day trades per 5 rolling days (applies even on paper for realism)

## Core Rules
1. NO OPTIONS — ever
2. 75–85% deployed
3. 5–6 positions at a time, max 20% each
4. 10% trailing stop on every position as a real GTC order
5. Cut losers at −7% manually
6. Tighten trail: 7% at +15%, 5% at +20%
7. Never within 3% of current price; never move a stop down
8. Max 3 new trades per week
9. Follow sector momentum
10. Exit a sector after 2 consecutive failed trades
11. Patience > activity

## Entry Checklist
- Specific catalyst?
- Sector in momentum?
- Stop level (7–10% below entry)
- Target (min 2:1 R:R)

## Buy-side Gate (ALL must pass before placing a buy)
- Total positions after this fill ≤ 6
- Trades this week (including this one) ≤ 3
- Position cost ≤ 20% of account equity
- Position cost ≤ available cash
- `daytrade_count` < 3 (PDT room on sub-$25k accounts)
- Specific catalyst documented in today's RESEARCH-LOG entry
- Instrument is a stock (not an option, not anything else)

## Sell-side Rules
- Unrealized P&L ≤ −7% → close immediately
- Thesis broken (catalyst invalidated, sector rolling, adverse news) → close even if not at −7%
- Up ≥ +20% → tighten trailing stop to 5%
- Up ≥ +15% → tighten trailing stop to 7%
- Sector has 2 consecutive failed trades → exit all positions in that sector
